# Simple markdown editor named `Mark⬇️`

Built with React for practice based on the [Challenge #3](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/inbrowser-markdown-editor-r16TrrQX9) from [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this in-browser markdown editor and get it looking as close to the [design](#design-to-replicate) as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local `data.json file`, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack CRUD application!

Your users should be able to:
* Create, Read, Update, and Delete markdown documents
* Name and save documents to be accessed as needed
* Edit the markdown of a document and see the formatted preview of the content
* View a full-page preview of the formatted content
* View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
* **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use localStorage to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed
* **Bonus**: Build this project as a full-stack application

## Ideas  

* Extend the project to add your own functionality e.g. add support for images, optimise for saving the formatted markdown as a PDF
* Train your eye for detail by getting your solution as close to the design as you can
* ~~Use a JavaScript framework/library to practice building using components~~
* Try estimating the time it will take for you to build the project. Then see if the time taken matches up to your estimate. Project estimations are a skill that is often overlooked but is important for professional developers
